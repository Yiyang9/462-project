Algorithms are first implemented to detect and characterize key features in the image. Then, the developed algorithm is used to match the corresponding features between successive frames and estimate the motion of the camera between frames. Develop data structures and algorithms to build and update environment maps. The 3D position of observed features is measured using information from multiple frames. Implement algorithms to detect loop closures, i.e., areas seen before the camera revisits. It involves comparing the current frame to the keyframes in the map and identifying similarities using feature matching techniques. Then, an algorithm is implemented to position the camera within the map, and the algorithm and data structure are optimized for real-time performance. At the same time, we can also develop a user interface to visualize camera tracks, 3D maps, and other relevant information in real time. Provide feedback to users on the performance and status of the SLAM system. Finally, the SLAM system is continuously optimized and maintained to improve its performance and scalability. Combine advances in computer vision and robotics research to learn about the latest technologies and algorithms.
