# For the second part, I will plan to select a scenario and create a dataset. Next, replace the dataset in step 1 and run the image for further SLAM processing. I selected a well lit and sharply defined stairwell for data collection. Then use the provided samples to reconstruct the scene based on the image. During the process of running the code, I encountered multiple errors due to given code parameters. After research and repeated debugging, I overcame this problem. However, there is still a problem of point retrieval failure in Matlab. I think this may be due to the problem where the motion between images is too large for the algorithm to find a match. So I reduced the motion between the images, giving them enough time to react. This makes the code run much smoother than before, but the same issue still exists at the end of the code run. I think this may be related to the resolution of the phone or because there are certain limitations in providing the code.
# Conclusion:Although the task was not completed perfectly this time. However, during my dedication to problem-solving, I gained a lot of knowledge about SLAM, such as various algorithms for map construction, such as feature point based methods and graph optimization based methods. In addition, I also learned that SLAM can not only create maps, but also achieve positioning functions.
